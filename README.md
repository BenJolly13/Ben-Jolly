Hi!  
My name is Ben Jolly. I am a recent ChemMEng graduate from Lancaster University.  
I began web design as a beginner in February 2021 and I have created this page to log my development.  
This page is dedicated to the basic web design projects as I progress.  
I'm not very acustomed to linking GitHub to domains so it's not as fluid as I would like. In the meantime please view my complete updated CV using the following link:

Thankyou!
